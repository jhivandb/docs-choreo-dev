# Choreo Platform Services Billing

The platform services you create in your Choreo Organization, such as databases, caches, or Kafka services are billed as part of your existing Choreo subscription. The cost is determined by the usage and service plan of each resource you create.

Key billing information:

- **Hourly billing**: Usage is billed based on the number of hours a resource is active. For example, if you create a database, cache, or Kafka service and remove it within the same month, you only pay for the number of hours it was active.
- **Fixed pricing**: Pricing is based on the selected service plan. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwidth usage.

!!!Tip "Try out the free trial"
    Choreo provides a 7-day free trial for all database types on the 'Hobbyist' service plan, available to free-tier users.
